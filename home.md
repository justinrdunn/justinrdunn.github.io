<div class="col-xs-12">
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">  I am a Computer Science student, as well as a web and software developer. I am currently studying at the University of Vermont to get a BS in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I have been working with the UVM College of Engineering web team to help redesign the site, www.uvm.edu/~cems/. I also interned at Intersil Corporation for summer 2015 as a Web Developer, helping to resposify their web-facing site using Adobe CQ and Bootstrap, as well as developing tools in SharePoint. I am looking to find an internship for summer 2016, where I can gain more experience and build connections in the industry.</p>
