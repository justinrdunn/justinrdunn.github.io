Two Monday Worship services down, first Life Group tomorrow! I have had such an amazing first two weeks. Week of Welcome was a success. Our Mugshots event went well. I think it was one of the best one’s we’ve ever had. A new venue encouraged conversation and intentionality. A lot of new students got connected to the group through the night.

The first Monday Night Worship was incredible! 60 students were in attendance, which is the most ever at a Monday night. There was a ton of energy in the room and worship was very powerful. The band did an incredible job learning some really challenging repertoire and it was exciting to have Sam Swanke playing for the first time on guitar. I’m hopeful to involve a lot of new students on the team this semester. There are already a few interested students. Being involved on the team is a way that certain students will connect to the group and be much more likely to involve themselves in other aspects (It’s how I got involved).

Last week, I had my “first” Life Group bible study, but it was the activity night planned so students could get to know each other and form relationships. We went paddleboarding at sunset and it was incredible! One first-year, Julio, got connected and was very excited to be in the crew! He is from Philly and had never experienced anything like paddleboarding at sunset on an amazing lake before, and all the guys were welcoming. I imagine Julio will be a big part of life group in these upcoming weeks.
