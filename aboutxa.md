This year I am excited to be apart of the Campus Missionary in Training (CMIT) internship with the University of Vermont chapter of Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship. I will be doing the internship under the direction of Joe Gavin and Mark Hoffman, both experienced leaders and missionaries.

Chi Alpha is one of four campus ministries at UVM. It is the largest of the three currently, but even so, only 40-50 students regular attend Monday Night Gatherings (essentially church services held on campus) Currently at UVM, only 1% of the 12,000 students are involved in a campus ministry in a city ranked the second most un-churched city in the nation and the least churched state in the nation. As well, UVM has a binge-drinking rate more than double the national university average. All this to say, UVM needs people willing to work and share the gospel with students and be a light to campus. That is a big part of my role on campus as a leader at Chi Alpha. We hold events, bible studies, worship services, barbecues, dodge ball, broomball: All these so that students can connect with other students who are believers and hopefully find a faith in Jesus. Fellowship and community are essential for the body of Christ.

As an intern I will wear the hat of leader and student. I will be the worship leader on Monday nights following my passion and my degree path from university. Part of my mission with worship is not only to lead the body in worship but raise up the rest of the team to be future worship leaders so when they leave school, they can then lead worship elsewhere and raise up more leaders. The team is so talented and all have the gift for worship and a heart for God. As well, I will lead a small-group bible study for guys and be a one-on- one mentor for those same students throughout the week. Overall, I’ll be a leader in the community whether it’s on the Spring Break mission’s trip or organizing the chi alpha broomball team.

As a learner, I will be taking courses on the bible, theology, pastoral worship leading, stewarding resources, team building, Christ-center relationships and much more all leading towards ministerial credentials. In the future, I am hoping to be a worship leader and this will be a great step in the right direction.

The internship spans from August 2016 - June 2017.
