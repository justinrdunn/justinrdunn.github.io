<p>On Sunday’s, I lead worship at CityReach church in Essex Junction Vermont. The church is part of a larger network of mission churches and is affiliated with the Assemblies of God. Currently, there are two services: 10am and 5pm. The worship team from Chi Alpha is very involved in the church leading worship and many students from UVM come to City Reach for Sunday service.</p>
